                  Starting up and managing a business as a freelancer can be a
                  big challenge. Besides being time consuming, there can be
                  issues such as not having a business license, how to accept
                  payments, lack of tech knowledge to create a decent website,
                  and how to market. The cost for all these things can add up

                  reinvestment, donating to charity, and more. It is in all

                CineD has asserted itself and innovated as an international
                platform for filmmakers in a disruptive market. A new generation
                has changed the industry in a very short time and keeps it
                constantly changing. In a comprehensive rebranding, we gave the
                brand a new visual identity to equip it for the future.

                The products and themes we create reflect us, our mindset,
                culture and experience. Thinking comes before action. And so we
                ask - or work out the basic strategy at the same time. On this
                basis, we propose authentic and innovative communication
                solutions that can be related. People perceive them and
                understand them – and remember them.

                As the largest online print shop in Austria, druck.at constantly
                invests in innovative solutions. And Then Jupiter was
                commissioned to revamp the web shop. In a multilateral design
                process, new touchpoints were developed that give customers
                easier access to the more than 200,000 products.

                looking for fulfillment – ​​and are therefore successful. They
                are leaders who have recognized that employees and customers
                come first. They are visionaries who think long-term and act
                consciously. Because they know that their work is always about

                fulfillment in which they have created an oasis of time out with
                their vision. And Then Jupiter advised the founders of the
                hairstyling salon from strategy to design and created a unique
                brand with them.

                  &nbsp;A co-operative (co-op) is a different kind of business.
                  Our Co-op is owned by individual members and other co-ops, not
                  big investors, and our members get a chance to have a say in
                  how we're run. Profits mean members receive money, rewards and
                  offers and a co-op can support its local community.

                    A credit union is a not-for-profit, member-owned financial
                    cooperative. Members, not profits, come first.

                    Our roots, which began in 1972, were initiated by Waterloo
                    Region District School Board teachers, Ray Eaton and Gord
                    Gamey, who believed in the long-standing principles held by
                    credit unions: personal service and responsiveness to
                    members’ needs. Through their belief and commitment in the
                    cooperative principals which are central to the credit union
                    foundation Education Credit Union was formed.

                  <span>
                    Educational Systems Federal Credit Union was formed in 1955
                    by a small group of educators who wanted to make a
                    difference by helping the members of the education community
                    achieve their financial goals and dreams. They volunteered
                    their time and pooled their savings to make affordable loans
                    to their co-workers. Our first loan was to a teacher who
                    needed to buy a car to get to work.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    Forming a credit union was the perfect solution for these
                    educators because they wanted to make a difference, not a
                    profit. Credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives
                    founded on the principle of people helping people. At a
                    credit union, after income is used to provide for necessary
                    reserves, it is returned to the members in the form of
                    higher savings rates and lower loan rates. There are no
                    outside investors pressing for higher profits at the expense
                    of the members.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    During our first decade, we were run solely by volunteers
                    from the education community and we operated out of a
                    classroom. During the 1960s, our continued growth prompted
                    our volunteer Board of Directors to move into our first
                    office and hire employees to manage and operate the Credit
                    Union.

                  <br />
                  <span>
                    As our Credit Union grew over the decades, other credit
                    unions that serve the education community began to join us.
                    Joining with other education credit unions has made us
                    stronger and enabled us to expand the branch network and
                    return more value to our members. We encourage other credit
                    unions to consider joining us if they share our core purpose
                    of serving the education community.

                    We attribute our continuing success to our commitment to
                    help those who work in education. We design our products and
                    services to meet their unique needs. For example, our
                    Premium Summer Pay account pays a high rate and helps
                    members of the education community save a portion of every
                    paycheck during the school year to cover summer expenses.
                    When members borrow to purchase an automobile, we offer a
                    Summer Skip Payment Option with their loan payments.

                    Today, we have grown to over $1.2 billion in assets and
                    serve 85,000 members. We have 13 branch locations and over
                    200 employees. We provide the financial products and
                    solutions you would expect from a large financial
                    institution with a commitment to the members of the
                    education community.
